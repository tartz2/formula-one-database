# Database description
Consider the following design for a database system for making educated guesses about races in Formula 1.
Every year there are 23 races. Each race has multiple drivers that compete in those races. The number of
drivers varies every year. Each race takes place at a unique location and on a certain date. Those drivers
each can get a certain amount of points for winning. The higher the driver places on the leaderboard the
more points they recieve. At the end of the season the drivers with the most points will get 1st, 2nd, or
3rd place. Each driver is also part of a team and those drivers represent a country as well. Teams will
also have points based on how many points their driverâ€™s earned. Each driver can also set a lap record
before each race at any of the race track locations.
This database will have 3-4 strong entities.

# Database challenge
We're interested in modeling and using existing data from recent years of F1 (Formula One) races to make educated predictions for winning teams in the future. We want to tackle this topic because the data is easily accessible and open wheel racing is a great motorsport to model a database after.
